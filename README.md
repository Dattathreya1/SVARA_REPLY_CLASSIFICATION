# üìß Reply Classification API
A machine-learning service that classifies short business replies as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**.

This project demonstrates the full pipeline:
* **Data exploration & model training** (Google Colab notebook)
* **Model serving with FastAPI** (`app.py`)
* **Environment management** (`requirements.txt`)
* Optional **Transformer fine-tuning** for greater robustness

Repository mainly includes:
- `app.py`: FastAPI app exposing `/predict`.
- `Dockerfile`: Container configuration.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `answers.md`:answering few questions

Click and open the link in google Colab, before executing all cells make sure
reply_classification_dataset.csv file is uploaded and HARDWARE ACCELERATOR in Change runtime type is set to GPU
